ThinkBack
=========

A better reminders app for iOS. 

Currrently a WIP, but the following features will be available in the final release. 

Text-processing for certain contexts.
  URLS open the browser (Chrome/Safari)
  Times set the reminder time
  "Read" opens an amazon/goodreads search
  "Call/Email" opens your contacts (with contact list access)
  

Also:
  Siri support? Figure out how to do that elegantly. Or if it's even needed.
